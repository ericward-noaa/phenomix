Description: The 'phenomix' package fits time-varying density curves to run
    timing type data commonly encountered in fisheries and ecology. Example 
    applications include to peak run timing curves collected for juvenile or 
    adult Pacific salmon, though could also be applied to other kinds
    of data such as hydrographs, plant phenology (flowering, leaf out).

Title: Fit density curves to peak timing data that varies over time
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: c(person(given = c("Eric", "J."),
             family = "Ward",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: The 'salmix' package fits time-varying density curves to run
    timing type data commonly encountered in fisheries. Example applications include to peak run timing 
    curves collected for juvenile or adult Pacific salmon, though could also be applied to other kinds
    of data such as hydrographs.
